        <p>The Hansen’s is an exhibition that gives a brief look into my life, my family, and my driving force that
          keeps me going.</p>
        <p>By now I’m sure you noticed this is my family. My goal in this is to have you the audience see
          my family threw my eyes, I will achieve this through my use of light, depth of field and patience… lots of
          patience.</p>
        <p>This exhibit will depict the simple pleasures that come with being around people, your family, your
          friends.</p>
        <p>I want you to look at watching TV, doing your hair, playing a game as moments worth hanging on a
          wall, to me art is meant to be hung on a wall.</p> -->
