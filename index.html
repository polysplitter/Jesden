    <div class="statement">
      <p>The Hansens is an exhibition that gives a brief look into what I believe is my strongest asset, the thing
        that gives me wealth, and pushes me to be better. By now I’m sure you have noticed this is my family.</p>
      <p>I will give you a brief history on this journey: Over 20 years ago I originally started college with the idea
        that I would get a degree, start a family, and find an awesome job. So, in spring of 2001 I started going
        to Lake Superior College to get my 2-year degree and find what I was interested in. I enjoyed my time
        there, took lots of art classes and graduated with an AA Degree. I immediately signed up to attend UMD
        and decided to get a marketing degree. Well marketing was not my thing, so I decided teaching was
        going to be my calling card. After a year of that I decided to make another change and move on to a fine
        arts degree. This has always been a field that has interested me because I always wanted to know how
        these beautiful pieces of art were made. In this time period I got married, bought a house, and right as I
        was going to start the last semester of my senior year, I was told we were going to have triplets. I
        needed to take a break from school. Well, I have an awesome job, I have an amazing family, and now
        it’s time to finish the degree I started over 20 years ago.</p>
      <p>My goal in this is to have you the audience see my family through my eyes, I will achieve this through my
        use of light, depth of field and patience… lots of patience. This exhibit will depict the simple pleasures
        that come with being around your love ones. I want you to look at watching TV, doing your hair, playing
        a game, and taking a walk as moments worth hanging on a wall. Remember life is short and art is meant
        to be hung on a wall.</p>
